# RPIBareMetalOS

This repository contains the code for a very minimal bare metal operating system built for AARCH64 capable Raspberry Pis.  The OS is written in C++, C and some assembly language and the repository contains a couple of very lightweight system libraries.

I have a series of explanatory blog posts for this project:
