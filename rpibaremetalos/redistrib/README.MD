These files are from the RPI OS distro and are the minimal needed to boot either the RPI3 B+ or the RPI4.

The *bootcode.bin* file is needed for the RPI 3B+ but not for the RPI 4.

The RPI 3B+ requires the *start.elf* file whereas the RPI4 requires the *start4.elf* and *fixup4.dat* files.

The two device trees (*.dtb) are labelled per the RPI version they support.
